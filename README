This repo presents a new framework, VerifiedDSP, for programming 8-bit
Intel 8051 series microcontrollers and designing embedded Digital
Signal Processing systems. It includes an 8051 simulator, a
prototyping framework for mocking out specifications, and some higher
level constructs to help programmers formalize the behavior and run
time of control loops.


It will be hard to make if you don't have a lot of things installed
(ie, coq, Ocaml core, as31). Shoot me a message if you'd like help.
